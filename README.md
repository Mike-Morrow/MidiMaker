# MidiMaker

MidiMaker is a simple notebook that creates music using the blues scale and random number generator.

This project doesn't use any ML techniques but provides a basis for adding some in. 

Many AI generated music uses raw sounds as the input and results are often garbled.

Reading in Midi files as the input and generating a melody based on that would be much simpler. Also restricting candidate note choices to a specific scale would likely make things sound better.
